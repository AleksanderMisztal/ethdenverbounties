Secondly, it needs to implement a cross-chain contract call that plays a non-trivial role in the application.

Demonstrate how your app users can benefit from optional transactional privacy with zkBob. </p><p></p><p>BOB is a decentralized stablecoin with opt-in anonymity and confidentiality features powered by a protocol based on zk-SNARKs. One of the disadvantages of these types of protocols is the sender needs to calculate a proof using their secret key each time, making it difficult to use a smart contract to automate such payments. We've done our best to eliminate this problem by introducing the Direct Deposit feature. You can now send funds to anyone in the privacy pool directly from the smart contract. This feature makes the zkBob protocol much more composable and suitable for integration where funds transfer can be included as a subroutine to other decentralized protocols. See more details in the documentation. </p><p></p><p>Some ideas (we'd ❤️ to see any other novel use cases) to start brainstorming from: </p><p>- Integration within open-source wallets </p><p>- Apps for DAO accounting </p><p>- Browser extension for zkBob </p><p>- Donation/fundraising/tipping apps </p><p>- Privacy for P2P micro-transactions </p><p>- Integration with DEXs/bridges/aggregators </p><p></p><p>Bounty </p><p>1st prize - 5,000 BOB </p><p>2nd prize - 2,000 BOB </p><p>Notable projects: pool of 3,000 BOB will be evenly distributed among all other notable submissions </p><p></p>",

      "acceptanceCriteria": "<p>Criteria To be eligible, the project should make use of Chainlink Functions, and the result of the Functions call should change the state of a smart contract on-chain. Nice to have: how you use Chainlink in the project description. It must be possible for the judges to find the Chainlink use in your code. Only the intention to use is not valid. You must present your project for the Chainlink judges! Projects whose team does not present will not be evaluated. We will look at the following criteria: - UI/UX/DX - How useful is your application? Is it visually appealing? - Blockchain technology application - How valuable this project is for decentralization and adoption of Blockchain and Web3 - Wow Factor - Anything not covered above! This is if you blow us away in some other way. Extra Alpha Users Prize: Since Chainlink Functions has just launched, we are celebrating alpha users by giving them a special backpack. For those of you that use Chainlink Functions in their dApp, you can go to our location (to be decided) on Sunday and pick up your backpack. Note that we only have a limited supply, so please hurry :) Resources Chainlink Functions -Samples Repo Chainlink Functions - Documentation Also you can get started with any resources by checking out the hackathon resources page. You’ll find: Documentation for all the Chainlink features Smart Contract Starter Tutorial Best practices utilized by top protocols like Aave and Synthetix Hardhat Starter Kits Brownie Starter Kits Truffle Starter Kits dApp Tools Starter Kit And unlimited demos. There are plenty of video resources on that page for step-by-step working and building with: - NFTs - DeFi - DAOs - Gaming - And more! Have fun 🙂 \"</p>",

For example, the proof of a transaction being included into the block would consist of: merkle path towards transaction in a shard, merkle path towards shard hash. For access keys and viewing state you would need to provide the path in merkle patricia trie.

This roadmap should include specific milestones that outline the steps needed to solve the problem.<br> <br>To begin, contestants should research and identify a problem that they are interested in, and that can be solved through the use of DACs. Once the problem is identified, contestants should gather references and research that support the need for a solution, and that shows the potential of a DAC to solve the problem. The problem statement should clearly articulate the problem, its significance, and the potential impact of a solution using DACs.<br> <br>Once the problem statement has been developed, contestants should create a short-term roadmap that outlines the key milestones needed to solve the problem, using DACs. This roadmap should include specific, measurable, and achievable milestones that can be converted into proposals and tasks for the DAC.<br> <br>The contestants will be using KORIS to convert the roadmap milestones into relevant proposals and tasks for the DAC. One of the features that KORIS has is a project management tool that will help to organize, prioritize, and assign tasks to the different members within the DAC.<br> <br>The hackathon will be judged based on the innovation and relevance of the problem/project focus, on the potential of the solution to be implemented as a DAC, and on the usability of the prototype application that is created on the Metis Testnet. The team that presents the most innovative and relevant problem/project focus, that demonstrates the most potential for the solution to be implemented as a DAC, and that develops a usable prototype will be declared the winner of the hackathon.</p><p><br></p><p>What do you get extra as a Metis Bounty winner?<br><br></p><ul><li><p>Eligibility for Builder Mining</p></li><li><p>Included in the DAOtribution campaign</p></li></ul>",

With CoW Protocol’s ERC1271 implementation, the protocol is set up to offer – in theory – any kind of order that a DAO might want to make. The possibilities are endless. Additionally, since ETH Denver is THE conference of DAOs, we thought it was right to focus on enabling DAOs to go to their next level. The goal for this bounty is to build a Safe (formerly Gnosis Safe) module using a new tool built by Zodiac, role modifiers. This new Zodiac module would allow DAOs to grant a role to certain address to unilaterally make calls to any approved addresses (for example: trading protocols, vaults, etc.), approved functions (for example: call swap from this contract only, call approve tokens from this contract only, etc.) and approved access roles. Implementing role modifiers creates the ultimate DAO treasury management setup. Such a module would allow any DAO to permission the activities of the treasury regarding trading, farming or degening – for example: Allow a DAO member (wallet) to trade with CoW Protocol without any additional signers from the multisig (or with one less signer that the current setup) Allow a DAO member (wallet) to always swap stablecoins to stablecoins in CoW Protocol with the treasury manager address Allow a DAO member (wallet) to perform a TWAP order creation with a limited amount of tokens from the ones currently held by the treasury We will award $10,000 to be shared amongst the teams that build and deploy the best Zodiac - Safe module built around CoW Protocol.</p>",

Better yet, all of the frontend source code on BOS is stored on-chain on NEAR, making your frontend fully decentralized. <br><br>To get started, fork our Lido component on bos.gg, or check out docs.bos.gg<br><br>If you need NEAR tokens to support your hack and deploy the frontend to mainnet, come by the NEAR booth!<br><br>You are an Ethereum developer, hacking on an Ethereum mainnet, testnet or other chain supported by Blocknative infra. Forking our Lido Component is a super easy way to customize and deploy your own component. These components can interact with your smart contracts or an existing Ethereum project, and then be embedded in your dapp or hackathon project. There are also many components available to learn from on near.social (check out the resources!). We believe developers should be able to store critical frontend code on-chain. So we built Open Web Components, a technology stack for deploying decentralized frontend components on NEAR Protocol. If you need NEAR tokens to support your hack and this bounty, come to the NEAR booth to get a free NEAR Wallet with enough tokens to support your deployment. This is a great way to learn about modular development of your dapps, and how easy it is to use NEAR to deploy frontend components. There will be up to 14 projects selected: First place: $5000 USDC Second place: $3000 USDC Runner-ups</p>",

      "description": "<p><strong>For first timers:</strong></p><p>If this is your first time at a hackathon or with your teammates, this blog post on organizing a hackathon team may be beneficial(https://tesla809.medium.com/draft-crash-course-how-to-organize-a-hackathon-team-29b221c23905). In our experience, a clear method of collaboration increases the chances of teams completing their projects, improves team efficiency, and reduces the time to completion.</p><p><strong>TD;LR:</strong> Innovations in wallet design for better UX/UI, plus lower fees, will help onboard the next billion users. Because good UX/UI like is magic. It just works.</p><p>✨The Magic: <strong>Account Abstraction</strong> unlocks innovations in wallet design by bringing web2 UX/UI convenience to web3, so that self custody is much easier and decentralization increases.</p><p>🤫 The Secret: Account Abstraction allows organizations to create curated web3 experiences to create smooth onboarding. <strong>With AA, we can adapt accounts to business logic needs, instead of adapting business logic needs to accounts.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>🔍 The Deets: By treating smart contract accounts at the same level as Externally Owned Accounts (EOA), we can break free from the EOA’s hardcoded assumptions. Accounts are abstracted because now the implementation and the interface are decoupled, allowing for customizable accounts only limited by your imagination.</p><p>A great example of Account Abstraction can be found in Raise Finance’s Blog: https://raisefinance.medium.com/the-power-of-account-abstraction-technical-overview-of-the-raisepay-wallet-8e8c43dee64f<br><br><strong>Dapp suggestions:</strong></p><p>Think of your own idea! Optionally, you can pick one of a few of the hackathon idea suggestions as prompts to user stories via the following categories:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Security</strong> to increase safety and self custody for users</p></li><li><p><strong>Onboarding</strong> to attract users and simplify interactions, reduced number of steps, or clicks.</p></li><li><p><strong>Retention</strong> to keep them</p></li></ul><p>Improve <strong>security using Account Abstraction</strong> via one or more of these:</p><ul><li><p>One idea is a general abstraction in multisig wallets for plug and play services: easily add fraud monitoring, KYC, or any arbitrary service.</p></li><li><p>This general abstraction can be used for multi-factor authentication via any medium: Gmail, Google Auth, etc.</p></li><li><p>Another application could be fraud monitoring or KYC service, where the service is one of the multi-sigs wallet signers: if configurable compliance rules work, sign. For example, if transactions are under a certain amount or accounts are not on OFAC list.</p></li><li><p>Another idea is a general purpose custom wallet generator: easy to create inter-linked custom accounts customizable functionality, using visual GUI tools. Think IFTT meets ETH.Build, meets Your Favorite Wallet.</p></li><li><p>An application would be the easy generation of compliant intra-web of accounts for organizations. This allows the segregation of funds and easier control of risk. Some accounts can only pay certain vendors, employee payroll, investments only in certain assets, taking deposits, etc. How can you map the payment flows of an organization to an intra-web of accounts?</p></li><li><p>We’d love to see any cool and innovative ideas you can dream of.</p></li><li><p>Some prompts to get your imagination going are: Deadman switches, interesting forms of social recovery, Emergency Escape Hatches from L2 → L1, Innovative Curve and Encryption Schemes, customizable allow / deny lists for DApps, social methods of crowdsourcing allow / deny lists, trading margin limits based on number of multi-signature signers, easy methods to generate new accounts based on DApps, safety vaults for safe storage like customizable time locks on certain assets to prevent stealing.</p></li></ul><p><em>Improve </em><strong><em>onboarding using Account Abstraction and Paymasters</em></strong><em> via one or more of these:</em></p><ul><li><p>paying the gas fees for users with Paymasters.</p></li><li><p>paying bills and fees with ERC20 tokens like USDC.</p></li><li><p>session keys: easily generate sessions keys to approve all transactions under certain customizable conditions. Super useful for gaming or immersive experiences.</p></li><li><p>multi-calls: no more signing several transactions, now you can batch transactions for flow.</p></li><li><p>Any out-of-the-box ideas you can dream of. Impress the world!</p></li></ul><p><em>Improve </em><strong><em>retention</em></strong><em> via one or more of these:</em></p><ul><li><p>Using Paymasters to reward on-chain activity like: pay fees or percentage of fees for users that meet a certain threshold.</p></li><li><p>Using Account Abstraction to help increase utility of assets.</p></li></ul>",

      "description": "<p>Moonbeam has a variety of precompiles, such as the batch precompile and call permit precompile that offer powerful functionality to builders which can vastly improve the UX for dApp users. The batch precompile allows you to combine multiple smart contract calls into a single transaction. These groupings can be atomic or nonatomic at your discretion. <br><br>The quintessential example of a batched transaction that simplifies the UX for end users is batching together the approval and swap transactions for DEX. Rather than a user having to confirm an approval transaction and a swap transaction, the user can confirm a single batched transaction that executes both within the same block. In this case, you’d want the batch transaction to be atomic, because there’s no need to approve an ERC-20 allowance if the swap reverts. <br><br>Another possibility is to use the Call Permit Precompile. One of the most frustrating experiences for a user new to Web3 is acquiring gas to pay for transactions. You can substantially improve your dApp’s UX by eliminating the requirement that the user hold the native token for gas. Moonbeam’s call permit precompile enables you to do exactly that - with it, you can dispatch any transaction in a gasless manner which can be relayed by Biconomy.<br><br>To be eligible for this bounty, your dApp should have at least some smart contract logic deployed to Moonbeam or Moonbase Alpha. Secondly, it must utilize the batch precompile or the call permit precompile (or both) to provide any non-trivial functionality to your dApp.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><strong>Getting Help </strong>- The <strong>Hackathons </strong>Channel in the Moonbeam Discord is the fastest way to get help.

      "description": "<p>A lot of DAOs are currently requesting a delegate governance mechanism, similar to how representative democracies are structured today. Many token holders don’t necessarily have the time to spend reviewing each proposal in depth, which is why some would rather delegate their voting power to someone else.<br><br>The objective is: build a delegate governance model for Aragon DAOs. Token holders should be able to delegate their tokens to representatives they trust to vote in proposals representing their voice. In order to do this, you’ll likely have to build a token wrapper contract as well as an Aragon governance plugin.<br><br>The token wrapper contract is for the DAO’s voting tokens (you can choose whether to focus on ERC-20s or ERC-721s or both). This wrapper contract should enable delegating functionality so that the token can represent the vote of someone else, without that person having to actually transfer the token to someone else. <br><br>Then, build a governance mechanism plugin that counts how many tokens have been delegated to an address when counting the votes for a given proposal.</p>",
      "acceptanceCriteria": "<p>- DAO members should be able to delegate their tokens to others<br>- Build a working plugin and publish it to the aragonOSx protocol<br>- Create documentation about how the plugin works<br>- Bounty will be judged based on effectiveness:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - DAO members should be able to delegate their vote to someone else<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - That delegated vote should be counted when counting the results of a given DAO proposal<br>- Bonus points for building a good UX/UI for this<br>- Other contracts from the ecosystem may be used and repurposed.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Risk management and mitigation are of paramount importance in any development product, and are existential to the blockchain domain. In the last few years, the industry has witnessed a myriad of security breaches and abusive use cases - this has to stop! <br><br>The composability of DeFi enables the BNB dApps to connect with the rest of the ecosystem; however, it also exposes the whole ecosystem as well as its users to various risks. At least three different aspects of risk are important to assessing whether an asset exposes the BNB Chain to undue risk: smart contract risk, counter-party risk, and market risk.<br><br>To address smart contract risk, over the last year, BNB Chain has introduced AvengerDAO security initiative to protect users from financial losses and deter malicious actors and applications, and it has been a huge success. Through partnerships with the leading industry security organizations, we've managed to considerably reduce the number of misdeeds on the BNB Smart Chain. <br><br>During this year we want to address the counter-party and market risks. As part of the challenge you’re to design an implement either one of them as a framework exposing API to the potential users. You can use any methodology as long as it has academical backing with references to the research papers. As bonus points you can add some sort of user interface to visualize the results. <br><br>Please see more details to what counter-party and market risks are.<br>Counter-party risk assesses qualitatively how and by who the asset is governed. There are different degrees of governance decentralization that may give direct control over funds (e.g., as backing) or attack vectors to the governance architecture, which could expose control and funds. Counterparty risk is determined by the level of centralisation, which is measured by the number of parties that control a token’s protocol, as well as the number of holders and the level of trust in the entity, project, community or processes.<br><br>Market risks are linked to the size of a particular asset pool in the protocol, as well as fluctuations in both supply and demand. The markets need to hold sufficient volume to account for any liquidations in the particular pool (i.e., sell offs which tend to lower the price of the underlying asset through slippage affecting the value recovered). Market risk assessments usually involve assessment of the volatility and the liquidity of the assets, but additional extensions are welcome.</p>",

Nice to have: how you use Chainlink in the project description. It must be possible for the judges to find the Chainlink use in your code. Only the intention to use is not valid. You must present your project for the Chainlink judges! Projects whose team does not present will not be evaluated. We will look at the following criteria: - UI/UX/DX - How useful is your application? Is it visually appealing? - Blockchain technology application - How valuable this project is for decentralization and adoption of Blockchain and Web3 - Wow Factor - Anything not covered above! This is if you blow us away in some other way. <br><br><strong>Resources</strong><br><br>You can get started with any resources by checking out the hackathon resources page. You’ll find: Smart Contract Starter Tutorial Documentation for all the Chainlink features Best practices utilized by top protocols like Aave and Synthetix Hardhat Starter Kits Brownie Starter Kits Truffle Starter Kits dApp Tools Starter Kit And unlimited demos.

      "description": "<p>Number of Bounties:</p><p>This bounty will be distributed according to the amount and quality of submissions. <br><br>CoW Protocol is the only trading protocol designed with DAOs in mind. This is why it's the best way for DAOs to engage with it, since the world of possibilities that it has to offer is endless. Since ETH Denver is THEE conference of DAOs, we thought it was right to focus on enabling DAOs to go to their next level. With ERC-1271 integration into CoW Protocol, DAOs, smart contracts and the combination of both, are now able to sign messages as if they were EOAs (Externally Owned Accounts, like MetaMask). On CoW Swap, EOA users never pay for failed transactions because they sign messages to place their orders — but smart contracts don’t get these same benefits, since (before ERC-1271) they must place their order with an on-chain transaction (by calling the preSignature method). While this might have been a stopper in the past, using ERC1271 allows anyone to build any sort of tools that eases the management of DAO treasuries, their trading strategies, or even their buyback programs. We will award $7500 to the team that builds the most-creative demo of ERC-1271 automation tools for DAOs to be able to place orders on CoW Protocol – i.e. stop losses, Time Weighted Average Price (TWAP) orders, Good After Time (GAT) orders, etc. Attach a front end to the product and earn an extra $2500!</p>",

More secure? Can you integrate ML/AI to automate and improve audits? Marketplaces - Public goods are hard to fund? Can you think how on-chain multisided platforms can facilitate how to fund hard-to-quantify public goods like scientific papers, music, poetry, etc? Flash Loans - Can you implement a decentralized flash loans platform in Aurora? How would handle arbitrage? Would you be able to deploy your own arbitrage bots or use existing ones? Would you be able to get opportunities for DEXs deploying in Aurora. Gasless Transactions and Meta-transactions - Gasless transactions can be critical in many areas like video games where many small transactions are constantly needed. Can you think of ways of processing transactions batches that can be cleared with minimum user interaction? Can you develop a wallet that would make gasless transactions possible? NFTs + AI - Can you think innovative use cases for the integration of chatGPT, Stable Diffusion, DALL-E with NFTs? Can you create collections of NFT that evolve from previous collections from the same author? Can you address existing concerns about IP and stable diffusion? Criteria Resources</p>",
